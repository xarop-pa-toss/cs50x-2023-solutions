Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:

They were all pretty similar even as the amount of predictions went up. Germany and England always were 1st and second
and there was a clear group in the middle of the table as well.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:

I'd say around 10_000 to 20_000. THe result don't change that much over that but the time use gets significantly higher
