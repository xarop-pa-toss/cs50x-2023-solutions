Valence (positive feelings. however they are measured is beyond me) isn't high but energy and danceability are so I'm guessing this person maybe listens to some ballady kind of pop music, but also some higher tempo electronica.
There might be better ways to get the mood of a song, which could probably include a mix of genre + valence + speechiness but it would be subjective to each genre
